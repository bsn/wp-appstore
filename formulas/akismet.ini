description = "<p>Akismet checks your comments against the Akismet web service to see if they look like spam or not and lets you
review the spam it catches under your blog&#039;s &quot;Comments&quot; admin screen.</p>

<p>Major new features in Akismet 2.5 include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A comment status history, so you can easily see which comments were caught or cleared by Akismet, and which were spammed or unspammed by a moderator</li>
<li>Links are highlighted in the comment body, to reveal hidden or misleading links</li>
<li>If your web host is unable to reach Akismet&#039;s servers, the plugin will automatically retry when your connection is back up</li>
<li>Moderators can see the number of approved comments for each user</li>
<li>Spam and Unspam reports now include more information, to help improve accuracy</li>
</ul>

<p>PS: You&#039;ll need an <a href=&quot;http://akismet.com/get/&quot;>Akismet.com API key</a> to use it.  Keys are free for personal blogs, with paid subscriptions available for businesses and commercial sites.</p>"
