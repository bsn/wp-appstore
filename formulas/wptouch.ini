description = "<p>WPtouch automatically transforms your WordPress blog into an iPhone application-style theme, complete with ajax loading articles and effects, when viewed from iPhone, iPod touch, Android, Palm Pre, Samsung touch and BlackBerry Storm/Torch mobile devices.</p>

<p>The admin panel allows you to customize many aspects of its appearance, and deliver a fast, user-friendly and stylish version of your site to touch mobile visitors, without modifying <em>a single bit of code</em> (or affecting) your regular desktop theme.</p>

<p>The theme also includes the ability for visitors to switch between <em>WPtouch</em> view and your site&#039;s regular theme.</p>

<p><em>Now Available: WPtouch Pro!</em>
Totally re-written top to bottom, with a slew of new features like more style, color and branding customizations, themes, 10 languages, more advertising options, Web-Application mode, and more!</p>
