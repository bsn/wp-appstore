description = "<p>This plugin allows you to make a WordPress page or post link to a URL of your choosing, instead of its WordPress page or post URL. It also will redirect people who go to the old (or &quot;normal&quot;) URL to the new one you&#039;ve chosen (<code>301 Moved Permanently</code> redirects are standard, but you can choose a <code>302 Moved Temporarily</code> redirect if you wish).</p>

<p>This functionality is useful for setting up navigational links to non-WordPress sections of your site or to off-site resources.</p>

<p>You can also use it to create a hand-crafted menu that links to pages, posts, categories, or anything within your site.</p>"
