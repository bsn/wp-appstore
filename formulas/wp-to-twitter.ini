description = "WP to Twitter posts a Twitter status update from your WordPress blog using your URL shortening service to provide a link back to your post from Twitter.

The plugin supports a default Tweet template for updating or editing posts and pages, supports your custom post types, and also allows you to write a custom Tweet for each post which says whatever you want, using a selection of custom shortcodes to generate your text.

Additional features include:

*   Use tags as Twitter hashtags
*   Use alternate URLs in place of post permalinks
*   Support for Google Analytics
*   Support for XMLRPC remote clients

Any status update you write which is longer than the available space will be truncated by the plugin. This applies to both default messages and to your custom messages.
