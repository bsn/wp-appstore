description = "Paid downloads plugin easily allows you to sell any digital content. The plugin automatically delivers the product (temporary encrypted download link) to your customer after completed payment done via PayPal. Just upload files and insert shortcodes like \[paid-downloads id=&quot;XXX&quot;\] into your posts or pages. The list of supported currencies: USD, AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, CZK, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, HUF, ILS, JPY, MXN, MYR, NOK, NZD, PHP, PLN, SEK, SGD, THB, TRY, TWD.

**Using the plugin**

1.  Install and activate the plugin like you do with any other plugins. Once activated, it will create a menu &quot;PDownloads&quot; in left side column in the admin area.
2.  Click left side menu &quot;PDownloads >>> Settings&quot; and do required settings. Set your PayPal ID, e-mail address for notifications, e-mail templates for success and failed payments, download link lifetime, etc. You also can customize &quot;Buy Now&quot; button.
3.  Click left side menu &quot;PDownloads >>> Files&quot; and upload the files you would like to sell. In this section you also can set the price for your files, see all payment transactions, generate and see temporary download links. You also can upload large files through FTP-connection (upload them to folder */wp-content/uploads/paid-downloads/files/*) and assign them in this section.
4.  Once file uploaded look at column &quot;Short Code&quot;. This is short code which you can insert into your posts or pages. The short code is like that: \\[paid-downloads id=&quot;XXX&quot;\\] (XXX - is an ID of file). You also can extend this short code by adding return\_url parameter. For example, if you wish to redirect your customers to &quot;http://www.website.com/thank-you.html&quot; page after successfull payment, you can insert the following short code: \[paid-downloads id=&quot;XXX&quot; return\_url=&quot;http://www.website.com/thank-you.html&quot;\].
5.  Go to any post/page edit page and insert short code there. This short code is replaced by &quot;Buy Now&quot; button automatically (or by download link if the price is 0.00).

**The workflow at front-end**

If user decides to purchase your digital product, he/she can click &quot;Buy now&quot; button. After that the user will be redirected to PayPal website to do the payment. After payment was done (completed and cleared), the user receives download link which is valid 2 days (period of validity is defined by administrator). Download link is sent to user&#039;s PayPal e-mail.
