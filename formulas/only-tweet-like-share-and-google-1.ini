description = "A very simple social share plugin with just 5 social icons. Well the around 99% of the posts are share with these 5 social icons (i.e Twitter, FB Like, Google +1, Linkedin and FB Share) then why to have more. Lesser social icons means less load on pages and you pages will load much faster. Earlier there were just 4 icons. But upon the request of many of this plugin user I decided to add the Linkedin button.

Features of the plugin

*   Huge list of options to easily display the buttons where require
*   Support for `shortcode` to display anywhere inside your post/page
*   Display using function call (useful if you want to embeb the code directly to your theme)
