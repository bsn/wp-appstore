description = "<p>This plugin adds a checkbox, &#8220;include this page in menus&#8221;, which is checked by default. If you uncheck 
it, the page will not appear in any listings of pages (which includes, and is <em>usually</em> limited to, your 
page navigation menus).</p>

<p>Pages which are children of excluded pages also do not show up in menu listings. (An alert in the editing screen, 
underneath the &quot;include&quot; checkbox allows you to track down which ancestor page is affecting child pages 
in this way.)</p>"
