description = "FeedWordPress is an Atom/RSS aggregator for WordPress. It syndicates content from feeds that you choose into your WordPress weblog; the content it syndicates appears as a series of special posts in your WordPress posts database. If you syndicate several feeds then you can use WordPress&#039;s posts database and templating engine as the back-end of an aggregation (&quot;planet&quot;) website. It was developed, originally, because I needed a more flexible replacement for \[Planet\]\[1\] to use at \[Feminist Blogs\]\[2\].

FeedWordPress is designed with flexibility, ease of use, and ease of configuration in mind. You&#039;ll need a working installation of WordPress or WordPress MU (version \[3.0\]\[3\] or later), and also FTP or SFTP access to your web host. The ability to create cron jobs on your web host is helpful but not required. You *don&#039;t* need to tweak any plain-text configuration files and you *don&#039;t* need shell access to your web host to make it work. (Although, I should point out, web hosts that *don&#039;t* offer shell access are *bad web hosts*.)
