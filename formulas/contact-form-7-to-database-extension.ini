description = "Saves form submissions to the database that come from Contact Form 7 (CF7) plugin and/or Fast Secure Contact Form (FSCF) plugin.

CF7 and FSCF are great plugins but but were lacking one thing...the ability to save the form data to the database. And if you get a lot of form submissions, then you end up sorting through a lot of email. This plugin-to-a-plugin provides that functionality.

You will need to have CF7 and/or FSCF installed along with this plugin. When using CF7, this plugin also puts a menu item in the Administration Plugins menu where you can see the data in the database. When using FSCF, this plugin puts links on its Admin page. You can also use the \[cfdb-html\], \[cfdb-table\], \[cfdb-datatable\], \[cfdb-value\] and \[cfdb-json\] shortcodes to display the data on a non-admin page on your site.
