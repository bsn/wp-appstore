<h4>Upgrade to Pretty Link Pro</h4>

<p>Pretty Link Pro is an upgrade to Pretty Link that adds the capability to automate your pretty link creation, cloak links, auto-tweet them, replace keywords thoughout your blog and much more. You can learn more about it here:</p>

<h4>Detail</h4>

<p>Pretty Link enables you to shorten links using your own domain name (as opposed to using tinyurl.com, bit.ly, or any other link shrinking service)! In addition to creating clean links, Pretty Link tracks each hit on your URL and provides a full, detailed report of where the hit came from, the browser, os and host. Pretty Link is a killer plugin for people who want to clean up their affiliate links, track clicks from emails, their links on Twitter to come from their own domain, or generally increase the reach of their website by spreading these links on forums or comments on other blogs.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>Here&#039;s a named Pretty Link (I used the slug &#039;aweber&#039;) that does a 307 redirect to my affiliate link for aweber.com:</p>

<p>Here&#039;s a link that Pretty Link generated a random slug for (similar to how bit.ly or tinyurl would do):</p>
