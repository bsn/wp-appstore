                        <p>Every day, hackers take over WordPress installations and delete the user&#039;s data and blog posts and use their servers for illegal activities. Don&#039;t be a victim - we&#039;ll help you prevent getting your thousands of hours of hard work on your blog taken over by a hacker and deleted.</p>

                        <p>Our plugin identifies security problems with your WordPress Installation. It scans your blog for hundreds of known threats, then gives you a security &quot;grade&quot; based on how well you have protected yourself. You can fix the problems yourself, or you can use our help to do it for you automatically.</p>

                        <p>Our plugin and service is designed to be used by anyone from a complete newbie to an advanced PHP engineer.</p>
